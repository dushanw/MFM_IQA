# MFM_IQA
Multi Fluorescence Microscopy Image Quality Assessment toolbox

In this work we develop a tool to quantitatively compare 3D volumes of the same object imaged trough two fluorescence microscopes with different point spread functions (PSFs). Moreover, imaging can be performed at slightly different object orientations. The image quality assessment (IQA) metric developed here is useful to compare images of different systems in the absence of pixel-matching ground truth.
